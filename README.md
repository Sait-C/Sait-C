## Hi, I'm Muharrem Sait Çoktaş a passenger in this world

If I want to start with some keywords about me, I would say <u>**Learner, Developer, Producer, Manager, Leader and so on**</u>. While talking about me, I don't like saying really specific things because I feel stuck in something or like I'm missing something. I think big and look at big picture because of my vision and passion. 

## Let's start from the beginning...

Hey, I'm Muharrem Sait Çoktaş and I am a passenger in this world. I have a journey that I want to be successful and reach my goals to help the world.
My journey is about Technology (as you guessed 😅). I will explain this later.
