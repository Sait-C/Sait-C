## Hi, I'm Muharrem Sait Çoktaş a passenger in this world

If I want to start with some keywords about me, I would say <u>**Learner, Developer, Producer, Manager, Leader and so on**</u>. While talking about me, I don't like saying really specific things because I feel stuck in something or like I'm missing something. I think big and look at big picture because of my vision and passion.
